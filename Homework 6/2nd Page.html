        <h1> The Retro Climate. </h1>
        <p> When I was a Junior in high school, I was in my shop class working with CAD </p>

        <p> I needed a logo for an engraving, and eventually I found a picture of a vaporwave sun.</p>

        <P> I love old muscle cars and retro design, so I decided to do more with the vaporwave sun than just my assignment.</P>

        <p> I was thinking of starting a YouTube channel, and I eventually came up with the name "The Retro Climate". 

        <p> I still haven't started the channel yet, but I finally have the time and motivation to put my first video out.</p>

        <p> Since I have done some freelancing with video editing in the past, I have the skills to start YouTube well. </p>

        <p> Which will be super useful because I have a more surreal/creepy retro vibe to the content I will be making. </p>

        <p> Here is the logo, it looks a lot better as a .png </p>
